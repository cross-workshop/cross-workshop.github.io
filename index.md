# Class and Race Online Seminar Series (CROSS)

On Behalf of the Class and Inequality section of the American Political Science Association (APSA), we are pleased to announce that, beginning this summer, we will be launching the Class and Race Online Seminar Series (CROSS). CROSS is an online series that seeks to spotlight research that evaluates the intersection of class and race within the study of politics. Across both time and space, class and race have shaped and continue to shape politics in profound ways. As such, CROSS hopes to underscore why these analyses are necessary for our collective understanding of various political phenomena.

The seminar will take place on the *third Thursday of each month at 1 p.m. EDT (10 a.m. PDT)* between May and August. This means that the inaugural meeting will be on **May 19, 2022**.

We hope that scholars of various subfields, areas of expertise, regions, etc., will participate in this seminar. We are also especially interested in providing a platform for early-career scholars (advanced graduate students, postdocs, assistant professors, etc.) to share their work. The more, the merrier!

If you have any questions about CROSS, please send an email to either John Kuk (jskuk@ou.edu) or Jared Clemons (jared.clemons@duke.edu). One of us will be in contact upon receipt of that information.

Thank you, and we look forward to launching CROSS this summer!
